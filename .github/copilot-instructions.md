Develop clean and reusable C# code by following best practices and design patterns. Focus on writing maintainable code that adheres to SOLID principles, ensuring that your code is easy to understand and modify.
Do not over-engineer solutions; keep them simple and straightforward. Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance where necessary.

When making changes, ensure that you:
- Do not use string.IsNullOrEmpty(), instead using string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace().
- Do not add unnecessary comments; the code should be self-explanatory. This includes doc comments. 
- Private vaiables should be prefixed with an underscore (e.g., `_privateVariable`).
- Use `var` when the type is obvious from the right-hand side of the assignment.
In an extreme case, you can add a comment to explain why a specific implementation was chosen.
